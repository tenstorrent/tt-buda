    (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the
    National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24\u201310 to earn their third Super Bowl title.
    The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.
    As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed
    initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals
    (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently
    feature the Arabic numerals 50."""
