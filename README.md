## Introduction

The TT-BUDA software stack can compile AI/ML models from several different frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, and execute them in many different ways on Tenstorrent hardware.

**Note on terminology:**

TT-BUDA is the official Tenstorrent AI/ML compiler stack and PyBUDA is the Python interface for TT-BUDA. PyBUDA allows users to access and utilize TT-BUDA's features directly from Python. This includes directly importing model architectures and weights from PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and TFLite.

## First 5 Things To-Do

For a simple, 5-step, starting guide on learning the basics of TT-BUDA please visit [first_5_steps](first_5_steps/).

In that directory, you will find the following user guides:

- `1_install_ttbuda.md` -> Installation guide for TT-BUDA
- `2_running_nlp_models.ipynb` -> Run your first NLP model with TT-BUDA
- `3_running_cv_models.ipynb` -> Run your first CNN model with TT-BUDA
- `4_batched_inputs.ipynb` -> Learn how to run with batched inputs and how to benchmark models on TT-BUDA
- `5_serving_tt_models.ipynb` -> Use FastAPI to host a model running on Tenstorrent hardware to build custom APIs
